# QR Code Scanning System - Implementation Guide

## Overview
The QR code scanning system has been enhanced to show detailed situs information before starting a trip. When a user scans a QR code, they will be directed to a detailed page about the heritage site (situs) before being able to start their journey.

## How It Works

### 1. QR Code Scanning Process
1. User opens QR Scanner from the tab navigation
2. User scans QR code or enters it manually (web version)
3. System validates the QR code against the database
4. If valid, user is directed to `SitusQRDetailScreen`

### 2. Situs Detail Screen
The new `SitusQRDetailScreen` component displays:
- **Situs Information**: Name, location, description, year built
- **Estimated Duration**: How long the trip will take
- **Building List**: All buildings that will be visited during the trip
- **QR Code Info**: Shows the scanned QR code data
- **Start Trip Button**: Allows user to begin the actual trip

### 3. Database Integration
The system uses these database functions:
- `validateQRCode()`: Validates QR code and retrieves situs data
- `getSitusBuildings()`: Gets all buildings for a specific situs
- `startTrip()`: Initiates the actual trip when user confirms

## File Structure

### New Files Created
- `components/screens/SitusQRDetailScreen.jsx`: Main detail screen component

### Modified Files
- `components/screens/QRScannerScreen.jsx`: Updated to show detail screen instead of direct trip start
- `lib/tripService.js`: Added `getSitusBuildings()` function
- `database/setup-clean.sql`: Enhanced with proper sample data

## Testing the System

### Available Test QR Codes (UIDs)
- `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`: Candi Borobudur
- `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001`: Candi Prambanan

### QR Code Format
QR codes contain the **UID** of the situs (heritage site) directly. When scanned, the system:
1. Validates the UID against the `situs` table
2. Retrieves complete situs information
3. Shows the detail screen with all relevant data

### Testing Steps
1. Open the app and navigate to QR Scanner
2. For web version: Use manual input with the test UIDs above or quick test buttons
3. For mobile: Generate QR codes containing the UIDs above and scan them
4. Verify that detail screen appears with correct situs information
5. Test the "Mulai Perjalanan" (Start Trip) button
6. Confirm trip starts and navigation works properly

## Authentication Handling
The system handles both authenticated and non-authenticated users:
- If user is logged in: Uses actual user ID
- If authentication is disabled: Uses mock user ID for testing
- Error handling for invalid or missing user data

## Database Schema Integration
The system works with these database tables:
- `situs`: Heritage sites with QR code data
- `bangunan_situs`: Buildings within each site
- `user_trips`: Trip tracking
- `building_visits`: Visit tracking for each building

## Benefits of This Implementation
1. **Better User Experience**: Users can learn about the site before starting
2. **Informed Decisions**: Users know what to expect (duration, buildings, etc.)
3. **Educational Value**: Provides cultural and historical information upfront
4. **Trip Planning**: Users can see the full itinerary before committing

## Future Enhancements
- Add site images and gallery
- Include GPS coordinates for navigation
- Add user reviews and ratings
- Implement offline functionality
- Add social sharing features
